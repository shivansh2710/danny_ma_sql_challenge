# danny_ma_sql_challenge
This repository contains the SQL code of Danny Ma's 8 week SQL Challenge. Each week contains a new case study with different sets of business questions. The SQL dialect used to write the queries is PostgreSQL.

I still haven't completed the whole challenge. There are still a lot of questions which I wasn't able to answer. You are all welcome to contribute to this repository.
